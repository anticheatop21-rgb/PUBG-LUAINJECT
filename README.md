# Lua Injector

**Leaked / Shared by @Anticheat02**

This injector hooks into the game's Lua environment and bypasses Twitter login webview requirements by intercepting and modifying login-related functions.

**Note:** This is just an example. You can write your own Lua scripts and hook into the game's Lua functions to do fun stuff like skins, UI mods, etc.

There is another way to do this using `lua_loadBuffer` with UE4, but it requires updating offsets, so I have not uploaded it. Also, anyone can dump your Lua by hooking any of those UE4 functions that process your Lua.
