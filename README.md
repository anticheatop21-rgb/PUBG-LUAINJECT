# Lua Injector

**Leaked / Shared by @Anticheat02**

This injector hooks into the game's Lua environment and bypasses Twitter login webview requirements by intercepting and modifying login-related functions.

**Note:** This is just an example. You can write your own Lua scripts and hook into the game's Lua functions to do fun stuff like skins, UI mods, etc.
